# How to get started - Committing/Editing after forking:
1. You should use VS Code to edit your local repository. So the first thing you should do is download VS Code and set it up. Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Once VS Code is setup, open it.
3. OPTIONAL: Get some plugins (see below), since this will help to create a better development environment/speedup your work flow.
4. Now in VS Code, click on the top left "File", then click on "Open Folder" and open your local repository.
5. From here you can now add/edit files in your repository, and those changes will be reflected on GitHub Desktop.
6. Once you are done and want to commit (save) your changes to the website repository, commit and push commits from GitHub Desktop.
7. Check to make sure your local changes are reflected on the website. Once you've successfully committed via GitHub Desktop, you have now setup your work environment for the Portfolio Project!
